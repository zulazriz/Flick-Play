            <p>
                The film grossed over $375 million worldwide against a $90 million budget.
                It received praise from critics for its animation, direction, characters, story,
                voice acting, humor and soundtrack, and won numerous awards, including Best Animated
                Feature at the 91st Academy Awards, 46th Annie Awards, and 76th Golden Globe Awards.
                It was the first non-Disney/Pixar film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated
                Feature since Rango (2011), as well as the first non-Disney/Pixar film since Happy
                Feet (2006) to win that award when a Disney or Pixar film was also in contention....
