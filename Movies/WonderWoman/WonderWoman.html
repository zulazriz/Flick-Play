                In present-day Paris, Diana Prince receives a photographic plate from Wayne Enterprises
                (accompanied by a letter from Bruce Wayne) of herself and four men taken during World War I,
                prompting her to recall her past. The daughter of Queen Hippolyta, Diana is raised on the
                hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazons, women warriors created by the Olympian gods
                to protect mankind. Hippolyta explains their history to Diana, including how Ares became
                jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop
                him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his
                retreat......
